# plaintex-exam-template

## Owner
This project is created by Tomáš Jaroš, tomasek.jaros@seznam.cz, and @tommyjj83 on GitHub.

## Description
The template provided in this project is a universal template for exams. It allows the user to customise the exam's header, add or remove fields, and, of course, ask different types of questions by using prepared macros. Example usage of available macros with the explanation can be seen in readme.pdf, which is a readme dealing with the template itself.

The format used to create this template is PlainTeX, so it is universally usable.

## Notes
This template was created as part of a semester project for the course BI-TEX at FIT CTU.
